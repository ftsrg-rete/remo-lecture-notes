To rename the diagram, enter some name in the pop-up windows. If everything worked, Papyrus should be showing an empty Activity inside the newly created diagram. Note that as always, Papyrus does not show a diagram header or a diagram frame, which contradicts the SysML standard. Instead, we can think of the activity's boundary as the diagram frame. Creating a simple diagram From the palette to the right, grab an initial and an activity final element, and drop them on inside the main activity's frame. Furthermore, pick control flow from the palette, and connect the two elements. The resulting diagram should look like this: And in the model explorer, the following new elements should be visible (also, you can rename the top-level activity to something more sensible): Adding actions To add an opaque action (i.e., one without a defined inner structure), right-click the top-level activity in the model explorer, and choose Opaque Action from the UML for SysML 1.6 submenu of the context menu. Note that you can duplicate elements in the model explorer using ctrl+c and ctrl+v, so keep a \"template\" opaque action available to avoid having to always select the element from the complicated menu structure. Then, drop the newly create opaque action onto the diagram, break up the connection between the initial and activity final nodes, and insert the opaque action in-between. Even though Papyrus always offers the possibility to add a label to an edge, refrain from using this feature, because diagrams get very complex very fast. An alternative to the solution for adding an opaque action above, is to start drawing an edge from a node, and Papyrus will offer to create a new element. Choose an opaque action here. Adding pins So far, all edges have been control-flow edges. To add object flow as well, we need to define output and input pins on actions (possibly including the top-level activity). To do so, drop an output pin from the palette onto the opaque action created in the previous step. Then, create (in the model explorer) a signal, and add that as the type of the pin. Do not leave pins untyped! Do the same process with an input pin on another opaque action. You can find the input pin under the output pin's drop-down menu. So far, the diagram should like something like this: To connect the two pins, draw an object flow from the palette between them. Notice that even though SysML defines different graphical syntax for the control- and object-flow edges, Papyrus shows them both using the same notation -- be sure which type you use. The diagram will look like this after the connection will have been established: Adding signal-related actions So far, the object flow represented a direct and synchronous communication channel. In SysML, there is an alternative to this: sending and receiving signals. You can find these elements under the Send Signal Action element's drop-down menu in the palette. If you add a send signal action to the diagram, Papyrus prompts you to select which signal to send, or allows you to create one. Choose the previously created signal. Adding a signal type to an accept event action is a bit more complicated, because an event is much more than a signal . So, when you create an accept event action , it does not prompt you to choose a signal, but rather lets you define a trigger in its properties window. As we want to catch signals, choose the SignalEvent option from the Add Event drop-down. First, choose under which element to create the trigger (the most straightforward option is to choose a package). Add a name for the new SignalEvent, and choose the corresponding Signal (the one picked out when creating the send event action ). If everything went well, the new trigger should look like this. These actions above should result in the following diagram. Note that the pins on the send/receive actions are properly typed using the signal. To connect the elements, create object flows again. Interruptible Regions Unfortunately, Papyrus has a bug where an InterruptibleActivityRegion cannot have children. Instead, we can use an Activity from the palette (which would be used to model embedded behavior) and simply name it InterruptibleActivityRegion . We can do the same with an interrupting edge: adding a label asserting its type. Time event creation To let something cancel the accept event action added in the previous steps, let's add a timeout event to the interruptible activity region, which will cancel the wait after some time. Do the same as before by adding an accept event action , but choose TimeEvent from the dropdown on its trigger. Choose the container (a package, as before). You have two choices (do not do both): Name the time expression using the required timing (e.g., \"60 s\"); or choose a literal from the Expr drop-down, and document its unit of measurement (seconds) somewhere, e.g., as a note. Name the time event something sensible, and click OK. Pay attention to the \"Is Relative\" radiobuttons, because this determines whether the time action should be counted from the beginning of model execution (false), or the beginning of node activation (true). This has created an accept event action that waits for some timeout event. However, we cannot see this on the diagram. Even though the previous steps more or less correctly created the timing actions, they do not appear on the diagram. The alternative (and much easier) way is to create an empty TimeEvent trigger, and just use the name of the accept event action to assert the time event's value: Depending on the relative-ness of the timeout event, you can use \"after: or \"at\": All this together should look like this on the diagram: What's still missing, is the activation of the interruptible activity region, for which we can use a fork from the initial node: and also a way for the timeout event to interrupt the interruptible activity region: Notice that a merge node was more suitable for the task (rather than a join), because we want to exit the activity if one of the two inputs become active.","title":"Activity Diagrams Papyrus guidebook"},{"location":"rete-activity/#diagram-creation","text":"Inside the Model Explorer windows of Papyrus, right-click the destination package, and choose new diagram / SysML 1.6 Activity Diagram .

In the pop-up window give a name to the diagram. Hint : During BDD modeling the most used groups from the Palette are the Blocks and the Ports and Flows , so pin these. System Context To add an Actor during System Context modeling: 1. Select Actor from the toolbox: Palette -> Blocks -> Actor . 1. Place it on the diagram. 1. Edit the name in the Properties window. Block Creation and Settings: Select Block from the toolbox: Palette -> Blocks -> Block . Place it in the diagram, Hint : by holding the mousebutton and drawing a square the size of the block can be altered. Add a name to the Block . (You can always change it in the Properties window.) The Attributes , Operations , Constraints compartpents are displayed by default, these can be unnecessary, you can access the menu to hide them: Ctrl+F5 Right click on the block -> Filters -> Show/Hide Compartments You can edit these properties on multiple block simultaneously by selecting multiple blocks. You can add Part/Reference/etc. properties to a Block on the UML tab of the Properties window, in the Owned Attributes field. This is most useful for properties with primitive types, as you can add Ports or Properties typed by Blocks more easily from the Palette with connections. Relations between Blocks You can select from the possible Associations by unfolding the Palette -> Blocks -> Association We mostly use Association (Directed) and Composite Association from these. The Association should be handled with care, define Ports instead of referencing another Block with specific type. The PartAssociation can be misleading, it does not create the proper Part Property in the block, use the Composite Association instead. The SharedAssociation does not have proper semantics in SysML, avoid using it. The properties of the Association can be edited in the Properties window, like the names of the ends of the association or the multiplicities. Be mindful which end of the association you're editing! In systems engineering the source end of the association usually does not have a name, however in Papyrus a default name is assigned to this end (inherited from UML), you can delete this to make your diagram more transparent. The Generalization can be found outside of the Association : Palette -> Blocks -> Generalization Containment can be defined with Composite Association , do not mix it up with Containment Link ! Port Creation and Properties Select the appropriate Port from Palette -> Ports and Flows -> Port / Full Port / Proxy Port . Clicking on a Block add the Port to it (adds it as Owned Property automatically). Properties of the Port can be edited in the UML tab of the Properties window. The Type of the Port ( Block or Interface Block ) must be created separatelly and added to the Port in the ... menu. In order to make BDDs less cluttered, the typing (interface)blocks can be omitted from the diagrams, it is enough if they exist in the model. We advise you to put them in a separate \"ports\" package (either one package for the whole model, or if there would be too many of them, one ports package for each subsystem package). The Provided and Required interfaces field can only be edited after selecting the Type of the Port This might be the easiest way to add provided/required interfaces to the typing (interface)block of the port, as an interface realization (for provided) or a usage relationship has to be created for the typing block. There is no list for doing this in the typing block itself, but adding the interfaces to the port's lists automatically creates the necessary relationships in the model. Flow properties cannot be created directly in the diagram editor (it exists in the toolbox, but we could not drop it on any model elements from there). However, they can be added to the port's typing (interface)block in the model explorer: right click on the typing block -> SysML 1.6 Child -> FlowProperty . The type of the flow property (the thing that flows) can be specified in the UML tab of the properties window. It is mostly either a signal, a value type, or a block. The direction can be set in the SysML 1.6 tab. The type has to be created beforehand. The Is Conjugated switch reverses the Provided and Required interfaces and the directions of the Flow Properties . On BDDs, port labels do not show anything but the name of the port even when other properties should also be shown according to the appearance settings. This is a known bug (or rather lack of feature) of Papyrus. The properties are correctly shown on IBDs though. In the homework, you do not have to worry about this, it is enough if the port name is shown and all properties are correctly set in the properties window. Internal Block Diagram IBD Creation From the Model Explorer select the Block you want to define its connections: Right click -> New Diagram -> SysML 1.6 Internal Block Diagram Drag-and-drop the model elements contained by the Block to the diagram. To represent the hierarchy of the structure switch on the Internal Structure : Ctrl+F5 Right click on the block -> Filters -> Show/Hide Compartments Hint : a model element referenced by Composite Association has solid border, a model element referenced by Association or Shared Association has dashed border System Context Adding Information Flow Palette -> Ports and Flows -> Item flow The information can be set on the UML tab of the Properties window, however during this homework seting the name properly is sufficient. Connector Creation Palette -> Blocks -> Connector A Connector can be typed by an Association defined on the BDD, which can be set on the UML tab of the Properties window New Association can be added using the + menu. Existing Association can be selected in the ... menu. Binding Connector used to express the equality of the model elements, do not mix these up!

Start Papyrus from the papyrus-\\<version>/Papyrus folder Open Eclipse Marketplace: Help -> Eclipse Marketplace , then search for sysml and install the Papyrus SysML 1.6 extension. Pay attention to the version number. User Interface Model Explorer One of the most used part of the interface is the Model Explorer , which shows the elements of our model as a containment tree. The search field helps a lot with bigger models. New project, package, diagram From the File -> New -> Papyrus Project menu, choose a SysML 1.6 project In the Model Explorer windows, right click on the model -> New Child -> Package Right click on the newly created Package -> New Diagram -> choose the desired diagram type Diagram properties and the Palette The Properties of the diagram can be edited in the Properties window. The grid of the diagram can lower the trancparency of the diagram, feel free to try out different grids or simply hide it. The Palette contains (most of) the model elements you can put on the diagram in different groups, some diagrams have more elements than others, you can hide element groups which are not used and pin the most used ones. Deletion of model elements We have multiple ways of deleting model elements: From the Model Explorer , where any deletion affects the entire model From an opened diagram , where the element can either be deleted just from the diagram or the entire model .

Exporting diagrams We recommend exporting diagrams the following way: Right click in the Model Explorer -> Export -> Export all diagrams and select JPG as output format.

This should create the following structure in the model explorer window. Visually, the sequence diagram editor should look like this. Structure To add lifelines of participants (parts) to the interaction, drag and drop blocks onto the diagram area, or choose the lifeline element in the palette to the right. Messages (including found & lost messages) can be added via the same palette. To set the contents of the message, add the corresponding signal in the properties window (as a signature). Execution specifications can also be added from the palette. Ensure that the execution speficiation has reasonable start and finish points (events). Here, start is bound to the message reception, but finish has no constraint. Synchronous and asynchronous messages can be added from the palette to the diagram are between lifelines. Such messages need not contain a signal, if the semantics of the message do not require such specification (e.g., a return message does not need to specify a type). Combined fragments are a bit cumbersome to use, because they re-arrange the containment hierarchy in the model explorer every time they are moved (and thus include/exclude some elements). The type of the fragment can be selected from a drop-down in the properties window. The label of the combined fragment is added via simple string literals using the properties window. State invariants are added from the palette onto lifelines. The specification of the state invariant is done through the constraint pop-up in the properties window. Instead of duration constraints (which are not supported for SysML sequence diagrams in Papyrus), we can use time constraints at specific events. Add a time constraint from the palette onto a lifeline at a message send/receive point: Ensure that the constrained element is sensible (not unconstrained): To show a duration, use an initial \"t[N]\" label, then an offset. Here, a 10 second offset is used to specify that the duration of the execution specification is 10 seconds.

This should create the following structure in the model explorer window. Note the state machine has a single region (inside statemachine, regions and states alternate in the containment hierarchy). Visually, the state machine editor should look like this. Basic Structure From the palette window to the right, drag and drop an initial state, a final state and a transition connecting the two onto the diagram area. Now drop a state from the palette onto the diagram, and connect the initial and final states in the following way: This should create the following structure in the model explorer. Note that the Working state has no children. Now drop a state inside the Working state. This will automatically create a region inside the state (to preserve the alternating regions and states), and place the new states inside. Visually, nested states look like as follows (with added triggers between the On and Off states): To add behavior to the state machine, we can define triggers , guards and actions / effects on transitions. First, let's create a trigger on the transitions between the On and Off states. To do so, choose the trigger box in the transition's properties window, and create a trigger just like in activity diagrams. To specify which port the trigger signal might arrive, use the properties window: Visually, a trigger will appear as a label on the diagram. So far, nested states created an OR -refinement of the container states. To create AND -refinement (a.k.a. orthogonal regions), drag and drop a region inside the On state. Firstly, this is done without any problems, but when dropping the second one, the editor expects the user to decide how they want to divide the state (horizontally or vertically). Here, we chose a vertical division. Next, add a state and an initial state inside one of the regions, with a self-loop transition containing a trigger for the signal Ping . The Ponger state should reply with a Pong every time it receives a Ping . This is achieved by using an effect on the transition. Locate the effect box inside the transition's properties window, and add an opaque behavior. Choose a language for the opaque behavior. Here we chose to use \"Natural Language\" so we can use english words on the transition. Add the text describing the behavior to the text box on the right. An alternative to the opaque behavior (which uses informal descriptions) is to use an activity behavior. This will prompt the user to provide a name for the activity. In the model explorer, the activity is shows as the child of the transition - to edit the contents of the effect, create a separate activity diagram and drop the activity onto its diagram area. Visually, an effect is shows as text after the divisor \"/\" in the label of the transition. To create a history state (instead of an initial state), drop the corresponding element onto the diagram area. As the transition towards the final state has been triggered by the completition event so far (thus rendering the inside of the Working state inoperable), we need to add a trigger to it. If we choose to create a timing event, we can do so using the same technique as for accept event actions in activity diagrams. The summary can be seen below: Visually, time-based triggers are shown with either an after or an at label, depending on the relative-ness of the event. If we want to invoke specific behaviors every time a state is entered/exited, we can use entry and exit actions on the state. Here, the same rules apply as to effects of transitions - we can simply create opaque behaviors, or model them using for example activity diagrams. Visually, these labels are shown inside the state. To accept a trigger and then decide what to do, we can use the decision pseudostate. To create the guards, we can use the properties window of the transitions. Visually, guards are represented using brackets, as seen below.","title":"State Machine Diagrams Papyrus guidebook"},{"location":"rete-stm/#diagram-creation","text":"Inside the Model Explorer windows of Papyrus, right-click the destination package, and choose new diagram / SysML 1.6 State Machine Diagram .
